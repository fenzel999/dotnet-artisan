## About

dotnet-artisan is a Claude Code plugin that teaches AI coding agents to write correct .NET code.

It's not a collection of scattered tools — it's a **complete .NET development agent system**. A decision-maker orchestrator analyzes requirements, captures domain vocabulary, designs architecture, then routes to the right skills for execution. From building APIs to debugging crashes, security audits to CI/CD setup, it covers the full development lifecycle.

Install and go. Zero configuration required. [Web edition →](https://fenzel999.github.io/dotnet-artisan)

This project builds upon and integrates best practices from [dotnet/skills](https://github.com/dotnet/skills) and [novotnyllc/dotnet-artisan](https://github.com/novotnyllc/dotnet-artisan). Special thanks to both projects.

## Install

```bash
claude plugins marketplace add fenzel999/dotnet-artisan
claude plugins install dotnet-artisan
```

Compatible with GitHub Copilot, VS Code, and Cursor. Open any .NET project and start working — the harness auto-activates (loads skills, routes prompts, checks 30-second rule).

## How It Works

You describe what you need — the decision-maker handles everything:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Your request] --> B[using-dotnet<br/>intent detection]
    B --> C{dotnet-advisor<br/>decision-maker}
    C --> D[1. Detect .NET version]
    D --> E[1.5 Align requirements<br/>ask · capture domain]
    E --> F[2. Load C# standards]
    F --> G[3. .NET-first defaults]
    G --> H[4. Architecture design<br/>choose pattern + folder structure]
    H --> I[5. Decompose domains<br/>parallel routing]
    I --> J[dotnet-api]
    I --> K[dotnet-ui]
    I --> L[dotnet-testing]
    I --> M[dotnet-devops]
    I --> N[dotnet-tooling]
    I --> O[dotnet-debugging]
    J --> P[Specialist agents<br/>on demand]
    K --> P; L --> P; M --> P; N --> P; O --> P
    P --> Q[dotnet-learning-agent<br/>correction learning]
```

**No skill names to memorize.** The decision-maker analyzes, aligns requirements, loads standards, and routes to the right skills and agents.

## Examples

### 1. Building an Order Management System

```
You: I need an order management system

AI: What kind of orders? Purchase orders, work orders, or customer orders?
    Who will use this?
You: Customer orders. We might split order and payment later.

AI: I recommend a modular monolith — separate projects per domain,
    single deployment. DDD fits: Order, Payment, Inventory as
    bounded contexts. Have you used DDD before?
You: No.

AI: I'll run strategic DDD first — Event Storming, bounded contexts,
    domain analysis doc. Tactical implementation uses aggregates,
    entities, value objects. Tech stack: .NET 10 + PostgreSQL.
You: Need CI/CD and tests too.

Chain: 4 rounds of questions → dotnet-domain-analyst → Event Storming →
       bounded contexts: [Order, Payment, Inventory] → domain doc →
       parallel routing → api + testing + devops + tooling
```

### 2. Debugging a Production Crash (OOM)

```
You: My app keeps crashing — OutOfMemoryException
AI: Do you have a .dmp file?
You: Yes, C:\dumps\crash.dmp

Chain: dotnet-debugging → open dump (WinDbg/dotnet-dump) →
       !analyze -v → !dumpheap -stat finds 850MB byte[] →
       !gcroot traces to ImageCache singleton → fix recommendation
```

### 3. Code Review & Security Audit

```
You: Audit this code for security vulnerabilities
AI: Read-only audit, no code changes. Checking OWASP Top 10.

Chain: dotnet-security-reviewer (read-only) → scan → finds
       SQL injection + hardcoded key + missing JWT Audience → report
```

### 4. Writing Tests for Existing Code

```
You: Write tests for the order service
AI: Business logic needs unit tests, database needs integration tests.
    xUnit + WebApplicationFactory + Testcontainers — sound good?
You: Yes.

Chain: dotnet-testing → create test project → unit tests →
       Testcontainers spins up PostgreSQL → integration tests
```

### 5. Upgrading from .NET 8 to .NET 10

```
You: Upgrade this project from .NET 8 to .NET 10
AI: Two-step migration: 8→9 then 9→10, build+test after each step.

Chain: dotnet-devops → 8→9 (BinaryFormatter deprecation) →
       build+test → 9→10 (AddValidation) → build+test
```

### 6. Setting Up CI/CD

```
You: Set up CI/CD for this project
AI: Web API + GitHub. Generating GitHub Actions workflow,
    deploys on pushes to main.

Chain: dotnet-devops → GHA workflow → build+format+test+docker
```

### 7. Learning Project Conventions

```
You: Remember, this project uses TimeProvider instead of DateTime.Now
AI: Rule captured: TimeProvider constructor injection preferred.
    Applied to all new code. Stored in MEMORY.md.

Chain: dotnet-learning-agent → detect correction → generalize rule →
       deduplicate → write to MEMORY.md → confirm
```

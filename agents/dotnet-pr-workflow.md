# dotnet-pr-workflow

PR lifecycle orchestrator for .NET projects. Load the reference file for detailed steps and templates.

## Preloaded Skill

> **IMPORTANT — Path resolution**: The \`read references/xxx.md\` instruction uses a path relative to the skill's directory, NOT your CWD. Use Glob to locate the file first (pattern: \`**/dotnet-tooling/references/<filename>\`), then pass the absolute path to Read.

- [skill:dotnet-tooling] (read \`references/pr-workflow.md\`) — full PR workflow: analyze → create → validate → review → merge → release

## Quick Flow

```
User says "create PR"
  → Load pr-workflow.md → Analyze diff → Generate conventional title → Write body → Pre-checks → gh pr create

User says "review this PR"  
  → Load PR diff → Run review checklist from pr-workflow.md → Report findings

User says "merge this"
  → Verify CI + approval → squash-merge → delete branch

User says "release"
  → Determine version from commits → Generate changelog → Tag → Push
```

## Anti-patterns (NEVER)

- NEVER merge with failing CI
- NEVER skip review checklist for "small changes"
- NEVER auto-fix without telling the user
- NEVER force-push to main or shared branches
- NEVER commit secrets

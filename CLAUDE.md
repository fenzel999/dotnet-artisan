# CLAUDE.md — Context Reconnection Point

**Read this first.** This file is the fastest path to understanding this repo. If you're an AI reconnecting after a disconnected session, start here.

## What This Repo Is

A Claude Code plugin containing **12 skills** + 14 agents + **175** reference files for .NET development. It teaches AI coding agents how to write correct, idiomatic .NET code. Optimized for Claude Code and Grok (xAI) MCP environments.

## Session Recovery Protocol (read in this order)

| Step | File | Time | What You Get |
|------|------|------|--------------|
| 1 | `CLAUDE.md` (this file) | 2 min | Repo overview, rules, structure |
| 2 | `AGENTS.md` | 1 min | Iron rules, anti-patterns, key file map |
| 3 | `USAGE.md` | 3 min | Questioning framework, domain-driven analysis, workflow |
| 4 | `SELF_DOCUMENTING.md` | 2 min | How to write code that any AI can read in 30 seconds |
| 5 | `BEHAVIORS.md` | 2 min | 30+ behavior catalog + decision-maker routing |
| 6 | `skills/CHEATSHEET.md` | 2 min | All rules in one page |

That's ~10 minutes to full context recovery. No session history needed. Humans who only need install + "does it run?" start at `QUICKSTART.md`.

## Architecture (one sentence)

User prompt → `using-dotnet` (detect intent) → `dotnet-advisor` (route) → domain skills + `dotnet-csharp` (baseline, always loaded) → meta-skills (on-demand, including `dotnet-grok` under Grok).

## Core Rules (Version-Aware)

> Always detect the .NET version before applying patterns. Some features are version-specific: AddValidation requires net10.0+, STJ source-gen requires net8.0+.

1. **No Repository/UoW wrappers** — DbContext IS the UoW. DbSet<T> IS the repository. Inject DbContext directly.
2. **No FluentValidation** (net10.0+) — Use `AddValidation()` + DataAnnotations. For net8.0-net9.0, FluentValidation is acceptable.
3. **No commercial packages** — Free/open-source only. See `skills/dotnet-csharp/references/package-choices.md`.
4. **No DateTime.Now** — Use `TimeProvider` constructor-injected everywhere.
5. **Exhaust questions before acting** — Check the 7-item checklist in `USAGE.md`. If any answer is "I don't know", ask more. Never write code on assumptions.
6. **English only in skills/agents/references** — Docs (README, Pages) support Chinese + English.
7. **SKILL.md under 500 lines** — Detailed content in `references/` subdirectory.
8. **Reference file format**: Core Principles → Patterns (GOOD code) → Anti-patterns (BAD/GOOD or inline "AVOID" examples) → Decision Guide. Inline BAD/GOOD examples are acceptable instead of dedicated sections.
9. **All generated code MUST follow SELF_DOCUMENTING.md** — A fresh AI must understand any project in 30 seconds. Zero exceptions.
10. **Additive under Grok** — Changes via `dotnet-grok` must keep zero-config install and existing skills/agents/hooks intact.

## Skill Format

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: When and when NOT to use this skill (third person, triggers)
license: MIT
user-invocable: false
---

# Overview
## Routing Table (topic → keywords → companion file)
```

## Agent Format

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Trigger condition and expertise area
model: sonnet  # haiku, sonnet, or opus
---
```

## Quick Reference

- **Adding a skill**: Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` → update `INDEX.md` / marketplace counts → bump version if needed
- **Adding an agent**: Create `agents/<name>.md` (agents dir is auto-discovered)
- **All generated code must be self-documenting**: one-sentence file purpose at top, WHY comments for non-obvious decisions, domain terms in class names
- **Project must be understandable by a fresh AI in 30 seconds**: solution file → Program.cs → any .cs file → config
- **Plugin health (humans)**: Install → open any `.csproj` → ask “What .NET version?” → see QUICKSTART.md, GUIDE.md and `dotnet-workflow/references/plugin-verification.md`

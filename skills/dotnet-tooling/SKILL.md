# dotnet-tooling

## Overview

.NET project setup, build systems, performance, CLI apps, and developer tooling. This consolidated skill spans 36 topic areas. Load the appropriate companion file from `references/` based on the routing table below.

## Routing Table

> **Path resolution**: The Companion File column lists filenames relative to this skill's  directory. Use Glob to locate the file (pattern: ), then pass the returned absolute path to the Read tool. Do NOT use bare relative paths — the Read tool resolves them relative to the user's project directory, not this skill's location.

- `scripts/hooks/session-start-context.js` -- SessionStart hook for .NET project detection
- `scripts/hooks/user-prompt-dotnet-reminder.js` -- UserPromptSubmit hook for .NET keyword detection
- `scripts/hooks/check-self-doc.js` -- PostToolUse hook for .cs file quality reminders

## Code Quality Pipeline

Systematic 7-step cleanup for .NET projects. Each step: build → test → commit → next step.

### Principles

1. **Systematic over random** — Follow the pipeline in order. Formatting first, dead code last.
2. **Verify after each step** — Run `dotnet build && dotnet test` after every step.
3. **Safe removals only** — Verify dead code isn't used via reflection, DI, or serialization.
4. **One concern per commit** — Each step gets its own commit for safe revert.

### 7-Step Pipeline

```
Step 1: Formatting        — dotnet format (whitespace, indentation, braces)
Step 2: Unused Usings     — dotnet format analyzers (IDE0005)
Step 3: Analyzer Warnings — dotnet build -warnaserror (fix all CS/IDE warnings)
Step 4: Dead Code         — Remove unreferenced code (verify via Grep first)
Step 5: TODO Resolution   — Convert TODOs to issues or implement inline
Step 6: Sealed Class Audit — Seal classes not designed for inheritance
Step 7: CancellationToken  — Propagate CancellationToken through all async chains
```

### Code Review

Focus 80% of review effort on the 20% of code most likely to contain issues: new code paths, error handling, DI lifetimes, EF Core queries (N+1), async/await and CancellationToken.

### Anti-patterns

- **Mixing cleanup with feature work** — Separate commits, separate PRs
- **Batch cleanup without testing** — Guaranteed regression
- **Aggressive dead code removal** — Verify via reflection, DI, serialization first

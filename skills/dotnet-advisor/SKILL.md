# dotnet-advisor

Router and index skill for **dotnet-artisan**. Always loaded after [skill:using-dotnet] confirms .NET intent. Routes .NET development queries to the appropriate consolidated skill based on context.

## Scope

- Routing .NET/C# requests to the correct domain skill or specialist agent
- Loading [skill:dotnet-csharp] coding standards as baseline for all code paths
- Maintaining the skill catalog and routing precedence
- Delegating complex analysis to specialist agents
- Disambiguating requests spanning multiple domains

## Out of scope

- Domain-specific implementation guidance -- see [skill:dotnet-csharp], [skill:dotnet-api], [skill:dotnet-ui], [skill:dotnet-testing], [skill:dotnet-devops], [skill:dotnet-tooling], [skill:dotnet-debugging], [skill:dotnet-ai]
- Meta/workflow guidance -- see [skill:dotnet-workflow]
- Deep implementation content -- see the domain skills above and their companion files

## Step 1: Detect Project Version

Before any .NET guidance, determine the project's target framework:

> Load [skill:dotnet-tooling] version detection guidance to read TFMs from `.csproj`, `Directory.Build.props`, and `global.json`. Adapt ALL guidance to the detected .NET version.

Adapt patterns to the detected version. Some features are version-specific:

| Detected TFM | Use | Not available |
|-------------|-----|---------------|
| net10.0+ | AddValidation, TimeProvider, STJ source-gen, Mediator | — |
| net9.0 | TimeProvider, STJ source-gen, IHttpClientFactory | AddValidation |
| net8.0 | TimeProvider, IHttpClientFactory | AddValidation, STJ source-gen |

## Step 1.5: Align Requirements

For ANY request that is ambiguous, incomplete, or where you cannot confidently describe what needs to be built — **STOP. Ask questions first. Never guess.**

This includes existing code you don't understand. If you open a file and can't grasp what it does within 30 seconds:

> Ask the user. "I see this file contains X, but I don't fully understand its role. Can you explain what it does?"

**Comments are for AI readability.** Purpose comments in the `// Handles X: does Y, Z` format were written by AI for AI. You can read them to understand the code and update them if your domain knowledge improves. Any other comment format belongs to humans — don't modify it. If you can't understand the code, ask the user.

Load `references/requirements-alignment.md` for the 4-round dialogue framework (Goal, Architecture, Tech, Quality). Load `references/architecture-discovery.md` when the user's project architecture is unclear (monolith vs microservices, DDD decision, bounded contexts).

> Skip if the request is a full, unambiguous spec (e.g., "Add a GET /products endpoint").

## Step 2: Load Baseline

> **Prerequisite:** If you haven't already, read root behavior files in order: `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md` → `USAGE.md` → `SELF_DOCUMENTING.md` → `BEHAVIORS.md` → `skills/CHEATSHEET.md`. These define non-negotiable rules (TimeProvider, self-documenting format, 7-item checklist).

For any task that may produce, change, or review C#/.NET code:

1. Invoke [skill:dotnet-csharp] and **Read()** its always-load baseline references. These files are under the plugin's dotnet-csharp skill directory. Use Glob with the pattern `**/dotnet-csharp/references/*.md` to locate them, then Read each one (don't just scan the list):
   - `coding-standards.md`
   - `async-patterns.md`
   - `solid-principles.md`
   - `code-smells.md`
   - `anti-patterns.md`
   - `package-choices.md`
   - Also load: `../DECISIONS.md` and `../CHEATSHEET.md` from the `skills/` root directory (Glob for `**/CHEATSHEET.md` and `**/DECISIONS.md`)
   - `dotnet-releases.md` (under dotnet-csharp/references/)

   > **IMPORTANT — Path resolution**: The Read tool MUST receive an absolute path. These files are inside the plugin's `skills/<skill-name>/references/` directory. Use Glob to find them from CWD, then pass the returned absolute path to Read. Do NOT use bare relative paths like `references/xxx.md` — they resolve relative to the user's project directory, which is wrong.



## Step 3: .NET-First Defaults

In a .NET repository, default to .NET solutions for ambiguous requests:

- **"build me a web app"** → ASP.NET Core (not Express/Next.js)
- **"add a dashboard"** / **"build a UI"** → Blazor or Uno Platform (not React)
- **"write a script"** / **"automate this"** → .NET 10 file-based app (not Python). File-based C# apps work like scripts with `dotnet run`, support top-level statements, and can be published as native AOT binaries. See [skill:dotnet-api] `references/file-based-apps.md`.
- **"build a cross-platform app"** → MAUI or Uno Platform (not Electron)
- **"build a CLI tool"** → System.CommandLine or Spectre.Console (not Node.js/Python)
- **"create a spreadsheet"** / **"generate an Excel file"** → Open XML SDK or ClosedXML file-based app (not openpyxl/pandas)
- **"create a Word doc"** / **"generate a report"** → Open XML SDK file-based app (not python-docx)
- **"create a PDF"** / **"merge these PDFs"** / **"add a watermark"** → PDFsharp/MigraDoc file-based app (not reportlab/weasyprint/PyPDF2)

Only suggest non-.NET alternatives when there's a specific reason (e.g., the user explicitly asks for Python, or the task requires a JS-only ecosystem like npm packages).

## Step 4: Decompose & Route

For ANY request, especially broad ones like "build an e-commerce system", first DECOMPOSE the request into all domains it touches, then invoke EVERY matching skill in parallel.

### 4a. Domain Detection

Scan the request for signals across ALL domains. A complex project (e.g., e-commerce system) will match multiple rows simultaneously:

| If the request involves... | Invoke |
|---------------------------|--------|
| Backend services, Web APIs, EF Core, gRPC, SignalR, middleware, auth, OWASP, messaging, caching, YARP, document generation | [skill:dotnet-api] |
| Web UI (Blazor), cross-platform mobile/desktop (MAUI), cross-platform all-targets (Uno), WPF, WinUI, WinForms | [skill:dotnet-ui] |
| Unit tests, integration tests, E2E, Playwright, benchmarks, BDD, snapshot testing, mutation testing | [skill:dotnet-testing] |
| GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, containers, Docker, Git workflow, branch strategy, NuGet packaging, MSIX, release management, observability, OpenTelemetry | [skill:dotnet-devops] |
| Project setup, MSBuild, build optimization, Native AOT, trimming, GC tuning, profiling, CLI apps, SDK versions, code quality cleanup | [skill:dotnet-tooling] |
| Crash dumps, WinDbg, hang analysis, memory diagnostics (Windows) | [skill:dotnet-debugging] |
| Crash dumps, dotnet-dump, lldb, container diagnostics (Linux/macOS) | [skill:dotnet-debugging] |
| AI/ML, LLM integration, MCP servers, RAG, ML.NET, Semantic Kernel | [skill:dotnet-ai] |
| Claude Code workflow, parallel worktrees, context discipline, plan mode, verification loops | [skill:dotnet-workflow] |

### 4b. Parallel Invocation

Invoke ALL matched skills. For a full-stack project this typically means:

```
[skill:dotnet-csharp] (baseline — always)
+ [skill:dotnet-tooling] (project setup)
+ [skill:dotnet-api] (if backend)
+ [skill:dotnet-ui] (if frontend/mobile/desktop — multiple frameworks if needed)
+ [skill:dotnet-testing] (if tests requested or implied)
+ [skill:dotnet-devops] (if CI/CD, containers, or deployment needed)
+ [skill:dotnet-debugging] (if debugging needed)
+ [skill:dotnet-ai] (if AI features needed)
```

Order: baseline → project setup → domain skills → testing → DevOps. Each skill operates independently on its domain.

### 4c. Cross-Domain Coordination

When multiple skills are active, coordinate across them:

| When the task involves... | Coordinate |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Performance optimization or profiling | [skill:dotnet-tooling] (profiling references) + domain skill for the code being optimized |
| Testing a specific framework | The framework's domain skill provides context; [skill:dotnet-testing] writes the tests |
| Authentication in a UI app | [skill:dotnet-api] (security references) + [skill:dotnet-ui] (auth integration) |
| Building a new app (any "build me" request) | [skill:dotnet-tooling] (scaffold) -> domain skills -> [skill:dotnet-testing] -> [skill:dotnet-devops] |
| CI/CD that runs tests | [skill:dotnet-devops] (pipeline) + [skill:dotnet-testing] (test config) |
| AI/ML feature in a web API | [skill:dotnet-api] (hosting) + [skill:dotnet-ai] (AI logic) |
| Upgrading .NET version | [skill:dotnet-devops] (migration path) + [skill:dotnet-tooling] (SDK/version) |
| Code review or cleanup pass | [skill:dotnet-tooling] (code quality) + domain skill for the project |

## Step 5: Quality Gate

Before generating, writing, or committing any code, verify against these checklists:

### Self-Documenting Checklist (from SELF_DOCUMENTING.md)
- [ ] New AI-created `.cs` files have a one-sentence `// Handles X: does Y, Z` purpose comment at top
- [ ] Class names describe WHAT they do (not `Handler`, `Service`, `Manager`)
- [ ] All dependencies explicit in constructor (no service locator)
- [ ] Zero XML `<summary>` tags that only restate the method name
- [ ] WHY comments for non-obvious decisions only (not WHAT comments)
- [ ] Zero `Helper`, `Manager`, `Utils`, `Common`, `Shared` classes

### Iron Rules (from AGENTS.md)
- [ ] `TimeProvider` used instead of `DateTime.Now`
- [ ] No commercial NuGet packages (check against CHEATSHEET.md)
- [ ] No Repository/UoW wrappers (use DbContext/DbSet directly)
- [ ] `IHttpClientFactory` or typed client, never `new HttpClient()`
- [ ] No `.Result`/`.Wait()` — async/await all the way

### .NET Version Rules
- [ ] Patterns match the detected TFM (net10.0: use `field` keyword, net9.0: don't)
- [ ] Package choices match version (`AddValidation()` for net10.0+, FluentValidation for net8.0-9.0)

### Reference File Format (from CLAUDE.md #8)
When creating or editing a `.md` file in `skills/*/references/`, verify:
- [ ] First heading is Core Principles or equivalent context-setter (NOT Agent Gotchas, Prerequisites, or References)
- [ ] Follows order: Core Principles → Patterns (GOOD code) → Anti-patterns (BAD/GOOD or inline "AVOID") → Decision Guide
- [ ] Anti-patterns section exists (dedicated or inline BAD/GOOD examples)
- [ ] If you find a non-compliant file you're editing, fix its structure to match the standard order

### USAGE.md Checklist Confirmation
- [ ] I know WHAT is being built (one sentence)
- [ ] I know the DOMAIN terms and their meanings
- [ ] I have NO unanswered questions that would change my approach

If any box is unchecked, **STOP** and resolve before proceeding.

## Specialist Agent Routing

For complex analysis that benefits from domain expertise, delegate to specialist agents. Group by concern area:

**Architecture and Design**
- Architecture review, solution structure, build config, design patterns -> [skill:dotnet-architect]
- Strategic DDD analysis, event storming, bounded contexts, domain modeling -> [skill:dotnet-domain-analyst]
- General code review (correctness, performance, security) -> [skill:dotnet-code-review-agent]

**Performance and Concurrency**
- Performance (async, profiling, benchmarks) -> [skill:dotnet-performance-specialist]
- Race conditions, deadlocks, thread safety, synchronization -> [skill:dotnet-csharp-concurrency-specialist]

**UI Frameworks**
- UI frameworks (Blazor, MAUI, Uno Platform) -> [skill:dotnet-ui-specialist]

**Infrastructure**
- Cloud deployment, .NET Aspire, AKS, CI/CD pipelines, distributed tracing -> [skill:dotnet-cloud-specialist]
- Security vulnerabilities, OWASP compliance, secrets exposure, crypto review -> [skill:dotnet-security-reviewer]
- Test architecture, test type selection, test data management -> [skill:dotnet-testing-specialist]
- Documentation generation, XML docs, Mermaid diagrams -> [skill:dotnet-docs-generator]
- ASP.NET Core middleware, request pipeline, DI lifetimes -> [skill:dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist]
- Correction capture, pattern learning, memory management -> [skill:dotnet-learning-agent]

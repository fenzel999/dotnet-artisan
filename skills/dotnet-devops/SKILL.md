# dotnet-devops

## Overview

CI/CD, packaging, Git workflow, release management, and operational tooling for .NET. This consolidated skill spans 19 topic areas. Load the appropriate companion file from `references/` based on the routing table below.

## Routing Table

> **Path resolution**: The Companion File column lists filenames relative to this skill's  directory. Use Glob to locate the file (pattern: ), then pass the returned absolute path to the Read tool. Do NOT use bare relative paths — the Read tool resolves them relative to the user's project directory, not this skill's location.

## Scope

- Git workflow and branch strategies (GitHub Flow, Trunk-Based, GitFlow)
- Conventional Commits, PR lifecycle, automated review
- GitHub Actions workflows (build, test, deploy, publish)
- Azure DevOps pipelines (build, test, publish, environments)
- Container builds and deployment (Docker, Compose)
- NuGet and MSIX packaging
- Release management (NBGV, SemVer, changelogs)
- Observability and structured logging (OpenTelemetry)
- GitHub repository documentation and CI scaffolding

## Out of scope

- API/backend code patterns -> [skill:dotnet-api]

- Test authoring -> [skill:dotnet-testing]

## Version Upgrade

.NET version migration and project upgrade. Covers net8→net9→net10→net11 migration paths, AOT compatibility assessment, nullable reference migration, and thread-abort migration from .NET Framework.

### Principles

1. **One version at a time** — Don't skip versions. net8→net10 directly risks missing deprecated API warnings.
2. **Upgrade tooling before framework** — Update SDK, analyzers, and NuGet packages first.
3. **Assess before upgrading** — Run upgrade assessment tools to identify breaking changes before touching code.
4. **Incremental over big-bang** — Upgrade one project at a time, starting with leaf dependencies.

### Migration Paths

| From | To | Key Changes |
|------|-----|-------------|
| net8.0 | net9.0 | STJ 9.0, EF Core 9.0 auto-compiled models, HybridCache stable |
| net9.0 | net10.0 | C# 14 `field` keyword, AddValidation, EF Core 10 bulk ops |
| net10.0 | net11.0 | C# 15 preview, enhanced AOT, ASP.NET Core perf improvements |

### Pre-Upgrade Checklist

1. Audit NuGet packages — `dotnet list package --outdated --vulnerable`
2. Check global.json — Remove or update SDK version pin
3. Run upgrade assessment — Use .NET Upgrade Assistant
4. Review breaking changes — Check official breaking changes doc
5. Update CI/CD — Ensure build agents use the new SDK version

### AOT Compatibility

Before migrating to Native AOT: no `Assembly.Load` or reflection emit, no `dynamic` expanded at runtime, source-generated JSON serialization, AOT-compatible packages.

### Nullable Reference Migration

Enable incrementally: `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` + `<WarningsAsErrors>nullable</WarningsAsErrors>`. Fix per-project from leaf dependencies.

### Anti-patterns

- **Big-bang migration** — All projects at once = giant PR, impossible to revert
- **Skipping versions** — Bypasses deprecation warnings
- **Upgrading without running tests** — Undetected breaking changes
- **Mixing migration with feature work** — Separate PRs
